# BRAINSTORM — Vitreo Hub

## Competitive Analysis

### Competitor 1: Eyetube.net
- **Strengths**: Massive free video library, series-based organization, multi-format content
- **Weaknesses**: Cluttered UI (4/10 design), no filtering sophistication, no innovation tracking, dated 2015-era design, no personalization
- **Opportunity**: Modern UX with structured technique database and innovation timeline

### Competitor 2: Retina Today / Retinal Physician
- **Strengths**: Deep clinical articles, disease-organized taxonomy, surgical pearls video series
- **Weaknesses**: Static publication format, poor search/discovery, heavy sponsored content, 5/10 design
- **Opportunity**: Searchable technique database across all content types

### Competitor 3: ASRS (American Society of Retina Specialists)
- **Strengths**: Curated surgical video series, Retina Atlas, PAT Survey data, CME accreditation
- **Weaknesses**: Member-gated content, fragmented digital properties, dated 3/10 design, no AI features
- **Opportunity**: Public-facing, AI-powered innovation discovery platform

### Key Gaps (Our Differentiation)
1. NO innovation timeline exists anywhere
2. NO unified technique database
3. ALL competitors have dated UX (3-5/10)
4. NO AI-powered discovery
5. NO outcome/evidence linking
6. NO personalization or learning paths

## Domain Research

### Trust Signals Required
- Medical disclaimer on every content page
- Author credentials visible with specialty and experience
- Date of publication and last review on all content
- Sources/references cited for clinical claims
- HONcode principles as design guide

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
